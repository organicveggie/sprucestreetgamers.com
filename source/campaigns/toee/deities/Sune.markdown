# The Lady of Love
## Good Greater Goddess

{% img right /images/sune_symbol.jpg %}

The deity of love takes many forms, including that of Hanali Celanil, long worshiped as a goddess by the eladrin. She is the mistress of all that is beautiful and thrives on the most tender of emotions.

Many deities, from [Amaunator](/campaigns/toee/deities/Amaunator.html) to [Torm](/campaigns/toee/deities/Torm.html), have become smitten with the goddess of love, but she remains aloof (though flirtatious), reserving her love for the mortals who revere her name.

The worship of Sune is prevalent in cities and among the aristocracy, where people have the time to give proper attention to values such as romantic love and the preservation of beauty.

Numbering eight females for every male, Sune’s heartwarders are among the most beautiful humans, eladrin, and half-elves on Toril. Their informal hierarchy is loosely controlled by the most charismatic of the local priests. Her temples are monuments to the architectural arts, and her followers are asked to demonstrate love through an unselfish act every day.

She is also known as Lady Firehair for her lustrous red hair that drapes down to the ground, her eyes of shining emeralds and ruby red plump lips.
