### Background

Legends of the epic battles between Corellon (sometimes called Corellon Larethian) and [Gruumsh](/campaigns/toee/deities/Gruumsh.html) are the most repeated in the history of Toril. During that great struggle, the eladrin were born of Corellon’s blood. He is the benevolent ruler of Arvandor and the leader of the Seldarine ("the fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood"), god and exarchs who embody the eladrin’s proud and ancient traditions.

Though he is a skilled warrior, it is his love of the eladrin and their great works of magic and beauty that inspires Corellon. That inspiration is returned to his people a thousandfold.

Corellon’s feywardens are charged with protecting the traditions and works of their race. They turn aside political power, acting as advisors to the kings and queens of the elven realms.

The holiest day for Corellites is Shieldmeet, but every month they gather under the crescent moon to observe Lateu’quor, the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon, praising their deity with a multitude of beautiful works.

Corellon is the patron god of all fey. He is the creator and preserver of the [Tel'Quessir](/campaigns/toee/people/tel-quessir.html), governing those things held in the highest esteem among eladrin and elves, such as magic, music, arts, crafts, poetry, and warfare. Corellon lives in the realm of Arvandor. He favors those who kill orcs and followers of [Lolth](/campaigns/toee/deities/Lolth.html), blesses those who aid others and becomes angered at those who defile the dead, or flee from their foes.
