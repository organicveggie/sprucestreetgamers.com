# Supreme of the Nine Hells
## Evil Greater God

{% img right /images/asmodeus_symbol.jpg %}

Asmodeus is the evil god of sin, tyranny and domination. He rules the Nine Hells with an iron fist and a silver tongue. Aside from devils, evil creatures such as rakshasas pay him homage, and evil tieflings and warlocks are drawn to his dark cults. His rules are strict and his punishments harsh:

* Seek power over others, that you might rule with strength as the Lord of Hell does.
* Repay evil with evil. If others are kind to you, exploit their weakness for your own gain.
* Show neither pity nor mercy to those who are caught underfoot as you climb your way to power. The weak do not deserve compassion.

He is typically depicted as the strongest, most cunning, and most handsome of all devils. His avatar is typically described as appearing as a giant human, over 13 feet (4m) tall, with dark skin and hair, red eyes, handsome features, and small horns on his forehead. He dresses in regal finery of unimaginable expense. Beneath his clothing, Asmodeus’ body is covered in bloody wounds which he sustained when he fell from the Outer Plane. His wounds ooze blood daily, and the drops of his blood which touch the ground grow into powerful devils.

Asmodeus is never seen without his [Ruby Rod of Asmodeus](/campaigns/toee/items/Ruby-Rod-of-Asmodeus.html), a glowing rod of pure ruby that serves as a badge of office as well as having several powerful offensive and defensive powers. The Rod allows Asmodeus to attack with elemental forces, force his enemies to cower in fear, or cover himself with a field which heals and protects him.

Like the other Archdevils of Baator, Asmodeus has the ability to cast many spells at will, and is nearly impossible to hurt without the use of very powerful holy magic weapons. Asmodeus’ Ruby Rod allows him to use several powerful offensive and defensive spells at will. In addition, Asmodeus has the power to alter the form of lesser devils, including the other lords of Baator. He transformed Mammon into a humanoid/serpent hybrid, and cursed Baalzebul with the form of a gigantic slug with tiny, useless arms.
