# The Black Lord
## Evil Greater God

{% img right /images/bane_symbol.jpg %}

Evil god of murder, war and conquest. Thought to have been destroyed forever during the Time of Troubles, Bane returned to life in 1372 DR and continued his mission to dominate every mortal soul on Toril. The Black Lord of Banehold is the embodiment of tyranny.

Bane’s lust for power doesn’t stop at the mystical walls that separate the world from the heartless gray hellscape of Banehold. Bane also seeks lordship over other deities, and he has killed and absorbed the essence and followers of numerous divine beings. He has drawn others into his command, including the goblin deities Maglubiyet and Hruggek and his consort, the twisted goddess Loviatar.

Banite priests are expected to strive constantly for dominance over those around them. No holy days are observed in Bane’s name, and the god scorns invocations that are not accompanied by proof of temporal power over others. When a mortal swears fealty to Bane, that service is absolute.

Militaristic nations of humans and goblins serve him and conquer in his name. Evil fighters and paladins serve him. He commands his worshipers to:

* Never allow your fear to gain mastery over you, but drive it into the hearts of your foes.
* Punish insubordination and disorder.
* Hone your combat skills to perfection, whether you are a mighty general or a lone mercenary.
