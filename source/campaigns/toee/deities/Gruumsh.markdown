# The One-Eyed God
## Chaotic Evil Greater God

{% img right /images/gruumsh_symbol.jpg %}

God of destruction, Gruumsh’s influence has flourished in recent decades with the growth of the orc population, and as other humanoids have come under his sway. His recent triumphs include putting the orc pantheon and other minor deities of the savage races under his thumb.

Though Gruumans maintain that their god was born with one eye, the eladrin assert that he lost an eye in combat with [Corellon](/deities/Corellon.html). The two divine powers have fought countless times, and they remain the bitterest of enemies.

Gruumsh is a god of conquest, driving his savage multitudes to expand their power by whatever brutal means they wish. His shamans advise chiefs and warmongers to raid, kill, and conquer.

The last day of Marpenoth, which Gruumans call Gharfek'taaz ("Feast of the Bloodied Stones"), commemorates Gruumsh’s ascendancy as the master of Nishrek. On this day, new shamans are ordained in a bloody orgy of torture and sacrifice.

Where [Bane](/deities/Bane.html) commands conquest, Gruumsh exhorts his followers to slaughter and pillage. Orcs are his fervent followers, and they bear a particular hatred for elves and eladrin because Corellon put out one of Gruumsh’s eyes. The One-Eyed God gives simple orders to his followers:

* Conquer and destroy.
* Let your strength crush the weak.
* Do as you will, and let no one stop you.
