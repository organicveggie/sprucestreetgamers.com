# The Moonmaiden
## Good Greater Goddess

{% img right /images/Selune.jpg %}

Together with her sister [Shar](/campaigns/toee/deities/Shar.html), Selune created Abeir-Toril from the cosmic ether and assisted [Chauntea](/campaigns/toee/deities/Chauntea.html) as she blessed the twin worlds with life. She has infused her spirit into the moon and forever looks down on the world she helped create.

Seluneâ€™s influence on Toril is felt in the ebb and flow of the tides and in the comforting silver glow of a moonlit night. She brings light to darkness, holding back the tide of evil embodied by her shadowy sister.

Mostly female, the Selunite priests known as silverstars administer to their flocks with patience and compassion, letting all know that "anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selune."

Silverstars are particularly interested in combating the dark side of lycanthropy. They wander Toril in search of werecreatures, hoping to aid them in maintaining or regaining control, or destroying those who have allowed their humanity to be overwhelmed by their affliction.

She is also venerated in as a goddess of light, stars, navigation, navigators, wanderers, questers, and goodly lycanthropes.
