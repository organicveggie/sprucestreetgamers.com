# The Forest Father
## Unaligned Greater God

{% img right /images/silvanus_symbol.jpg %}

The protector of the wild places, Silvanus is often seen as the deity of angry and vengeful druids who value the life of a tree over the life of a person. In fact, Silvanus teaches his followers to value all life. Still, his influence can be properly interpreted either as a wholesome respect for the natural world, or as a threat to the livelihood of expanding civilizations.

Druids of Silvanus say their prayers at sundown and set aside the days of Greengrass, Midsummer, and Highharvestide for meditation and communion with their deity and his affiliated powers. Seemingly at whim, Silvanus brings the natural world to sentient life, with streams finding their own courses and trees uprooting to walk around. This event, known as the Night the Forest Walks, can be localized or global in effect, entirely dependent on the unknowable desires of the Treefather.

Silvanus teaches his druids to watch from the protection of the woods, not to judge too quickly, and to preserve the balance of life and death, growth and decay.

Silvanus, one of the most prominent and oldest deities in Faerun, and the wilder counterpart to [Chauntea](/campaigns/toee/deities/Chauntea.html), the Earthmother. His worshipers protect places of nature from the encroachment of civilization with vigor and are implacable foes of industrious peoples.
