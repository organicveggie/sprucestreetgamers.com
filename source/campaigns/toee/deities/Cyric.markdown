### Background

{% img right /images/cyric.jpg %}

God of strife and lies. He traditionally has an immense following, although his number of followers has diminished somewhat since he murdered Mystra and caused the Spellplague. Cyric is closely associated with the essence of murder, conflict, lies, intrigue, and illusions. Cyric is recognized in by his symbol, a white jaw less skull on black or purple sunburst.

Cyric hates most of the other deities of Toril, but he particularly loathes Mystra, [Kelemvor](/campaigns/toee/deities/Kelemvor.html) and [Bane](/campaigns/toee/deities/Bane.html).

### Timeline
* 1358 DR – On Marpenoth 15, Cyric ascended into godhood.
* 1385 DR – Lathander, [Tyr](/campaigns/toee/deities/Tyr.html) and [Sune](/campaigns/toee/deities/Sune.html) trap Cyric in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years as payback for the death of Mystra.
