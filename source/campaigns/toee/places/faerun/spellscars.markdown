Spellscars are usually gained when creatures come too close to a [plagueland](/campaigns/toee/places/faerun/plagueland.html), though sometimes they afflict beings who have never had any contact with rampant magic. Sometimes a spellscar is a physical abnormality, but more often it is an intangible mark that appears only when its power is activated. An active spellscar might appear as jagged cracks of blue light racing across the forearms and hands, a corona of cerulean flame, a blazing blue glyph on the forehead, or perhaps even wings of cobalt flame. In all instances, blue fire is a sure indicator of a spellscar.

A creature can learn to master its spellscar through a variety of methods. (The FORGOTTEN REALMS Player’s Guide has more information.) Some beings travel to plaguelands in hopes of gaining a spellscar; such “scar pilgrimages” are encouraged by an organization called the Order of Blue Flame.
