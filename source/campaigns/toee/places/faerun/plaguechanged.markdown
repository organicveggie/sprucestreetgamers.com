A massive change in body and mind marks a creature that has survived contact with the original wave of the [Spellplague](/campaigns/toee/places/faerun/spellplague.html). Such survivors are called the _plaguechanged_. Few of their descendants survive today — the initial plague was so virulent, and the changes wrought were so extreme. As well, many decades have passed since the Spellplague’s end, and old age claimed most of the plaguechanged. A few of the horrifying things bred true, though.

Plaguechanged creatures are monsters, whatever their original race, driven insane by their dreadful metamorphosis. Even the least of them display potent abilities. Luckily, few of these creatures leave the plaguelands.
