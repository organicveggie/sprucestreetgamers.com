The Inn of Lost Dignity is an unmistakable site on the roads through [Teshwave](/places/teshwave.html). Being in the central intersection of the two main roads in town it is impossible to miss. Just look for the sign with a picture of two legs sticking out of a barrel. The food is mediocre, the drinks are good (The Boars Blood, and Dragonâ€™s Breath come highly recommended at 3cp). Stables for up to a dozen horses, plus a pen for a dozen more. The Bar seats 50 comfortably with a fire place and small stage. With only ten rooms and a great location, expect to pay a premium. This is an excellent place to pick up news of the surrounding country.
