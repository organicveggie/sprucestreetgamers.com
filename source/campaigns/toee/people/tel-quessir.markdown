Tel'Quessir are a number of closely related, long lived fey races commonly known as elves, though this term is now acknowledged to be techically inaccurate. Nonetheless, the name is common and many of the Tel'Quessir consider themselves as one larger culture, an attitude not unjustified given that nearly all Tel'Quessir speak elven and share a common history together. Perhaps more importantly, the Tel'Quessir were once one race, generally assumed to have been the eladrin or "high elves."

For these reasons and others, the Tel'Quessir are often considered as though they were one race and called "elves."

## Races
* Eladrin – includes dark elves, green elves, moon elves, star elves, and sun elves. They have a close relationship with the Feywild and magic.
* Elves – includes wild elves and wood elves. They have a stronger bond with nature than the eladrin.
* Drow – cursed by the god Corellon, these Tel'Quessir have an aversion to sunlight and live primarily underground.

There are several other sub-races of Tel'Quessir as well, and it's not clear if they fit neatly into one of the above three sub-categories. They include:

* Avariel – A race of winged elves. They live in crystal cities high in the mountains.
* Aquatic Elf – A race of elves that can breathe water. Like their land-bound counterparts they have giant cities protected by mythals.
* Lythari – A race of elves that can transform into wolves, though not into a hybrid form like lycanthropes.

While not strictly a sub-race of Tel'Quessir, the result of a human and Tel'Quessir mating is a half-elf, half-eladrin, or half-drow, whereas the offspring of a Tel'Quessir and a fiend is called a fey'ri.
