## Where
Found in the mess in the ogre's room on the first lower level of the Moathouse.

## Text
To Kelno, Cleric of Akadi and the Temple of Air,

Know that the time has come to pick a side in the struggle. You are far to weak to stand by yourself and the hatred Alrem holds for you will lead to your destruction. Romag and Hartch certainly won't side with you, since Earth has ever been jealous of Water and Air. And Garnoth is gone; he will not magically appear to save you this time.

So, you have a simple choice. Either join with me or I will allow Alrem his revenge.

Sincerely,

Belsorrig  
Chief Cleric of Istishia  
Temple of Water
