## Text
To Romag, Illustrious Leader of the Temple of Earth,

As you know, our inability to locate and free Garnoth has steadily eroded the balance of power within the Temple hierarchy. Belsorrig, may Kossuth Lord of Flames burn his miserable body for a thousand lifetimes, seeks to dominate all of us and elevate himself and the Temple of Water. Already he actively pursues Kelno, trying to convince the Temple of Air to join with him. This must not happen!

I know you have designs on dominating the Temple like Belsorrig, but I urge you to reconsider. I am confident that I will have the Scroll of Confinement in my hands soon. With it, I will be the one to free Garnoth and will reap his rewards. You know that He will severely punish those who opposed His will and actively worked to prevent His Return.

Join with me against Belsorrig and Kelno! When I free Garnoth, I will promise you will receive your just rewards.

Sincerely,

Alrem  
Temple of Fire
