_Setting_: Forgotten Realms near [Shadowdale](/places/shadowdale.html). The adventure takes place in approximately 1479 DR, the Year of the Ageless One, almost 100 years after the [Spellplague](/fauren/spellplage/).

_Intro_: Many years ago, the villages of [Hommlet](/places/hommlet.html) and [Nulb](/places/nulb.html) were plagued by bandits, monsters and evil clerics. The forces of Good, led by the nation of [Cormyr](/places/cormyr.html), expelled the evil elements and the villages became a haven for adventurers and treasure seekers. Over time, interest in these small villages died away until they were almost forgotten. Now, rumors are spreading of new troubles â€“ caravans gone missing and farms raided. Is it just a small group of bandits? Or is it possibly something more sinister?

You have decided to seek out fame and fortune by learning more about these rumors.
