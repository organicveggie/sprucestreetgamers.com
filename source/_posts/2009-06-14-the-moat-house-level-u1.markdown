A recap of the last day and a half of our adventures. Following up from our encounter with what appeared to be a patrol of ominous figures sent to hold the moat house in preparation for the up coming 'push' for [Homlett](/places/hommlet.html) we descended into the lower levels.

The first lower level of the moat house held store rooms, cells, and an interrogation chamber. The store rooms were loaded, weapons supplies and small amounts of looted merchandise. (later we would discover from whom this had been looted.). The primary open room and all non-cells were fairly well constructed stone work. Though apparently unused for some time they have seen some recent occupation and do seem to be in better condition than that of the above ground keep. The cells were unkept and filthy, as would be expected. But not nearly as filthy as the last two rooms that we were to search upon this level. Those rooms were the abode of a vile Ogre , though he was smallish the foul stench that he exuded was by far the most powerful thing we encountered.

And while we are discussing our encounters let me remind you of what we did encounter on this floor. Our first meeting was with nothing too spectacular but your standard dungeon scavengers. Four gelatinous green slime . These creatures simply keep most subterranean areas clear by acidly dissolving things alive or not that are in their way. We dispatched these quite well. Though Faylinn's flames sputtered and Rathmine dug his Axe into me in an unfortunate series of events. Both Flashypants and I delivered wicked blows and held our own. Things we should all take from this encounter is to not rush in as I did (should have known better) and to be wary of attacking near your fellow adventurers.

The next surprise the we beheld was an unleashing of undead. Our first encounter of these horrific aberrations. And what more logical place then the hall that led from the prisoner cells to the interrogation room. Four zombie and two wight . Low level but still a fright for us in that the attacks of these creatures have been know to kill one instantly. A grueling battle followed. Trading of blow for blow between Rathmine, Flashypants and several of the Zombies. Faylinn fortunately unleashed her fiery hot ball amongst the close quartered foes. With but a few deft shots the undead were dead once more.

A through searching of the area commenced and with his highly skilled abilities Flashypants found a decrepit ladder leading ever lower. We contemplated decent for a moment but then turned our thoughts to the completion of exploring our current level. This left but one door for us to enter.

The stench emanating forth was all but unbearable. A loud dumb and unamused [ogre] was barring our further advance. Upon seeing this lumbering hulk we at once devised and fell into a simple battle plan. We bottle necked him at the door. From the rear our artillery attacks of arrows, arcane projectiles, and spikes drove home devastating blows. A sweep of Rathmine's axe and the ogre became no more than a large pin cushion.

His room was shall we say opulent for that of an ogre. Those who led him either held him in esteem or fear or both. Four artistic columns and a fine pile of furs were left to decay in the rank air. Hunkering down we allowed ourselves a brief rest to recover from our intense battles .
