So after the rapid dispatchment of the giant crayfish a short discussion followed. The discussion being as to rest, return to Homlett, or continue on. Faylinn on the side of rest, Rathmine, and Flashypants for continue, and me well, though I felt that returning to Homlett would be a wise action I had to agree with our two stout comrades in that none of us were in immediate danger. There fore the decision was made to continue to explore these catacombs.

In what we have seen and heard, or more accurately read, in our short time here as layed out the balance of several competing temples in the hierarchy. In our explorations we have in my thoughts at least dealt with both the temple of Earth representative, and that of the temple of water.

So being aware of our slightly diminished abilities we set forth down the hall opposite the crawfish pool. This led to us well being fairly indecisive. The original hall led down to where if I were to guess lie a pair of mausoleums. We choose at the current juncture not to open those doors. now this room did contain two other passageways, ones that we do need, I feel, to return and explore. but being as the room was fairly open, and we feared a possible ambush from several undead we left.

This led us to a rather average looking door that was positioned roughly at the midpoint of the hall. A few deft movements and the lock gave way and we we granted admission. Another hall, another door, another skilled picking of the lock. But the next hall brought an uneasy feeling to my stomach. Lined with fine looking tapestries this hall did not look like it belonged here. Well at least not in the catacombs of commoners. And from my learnings my desire to meet a more powerful being was shal we say lacking. But heading the words of my companions who put little faith in such tales we bravely (foolishly?) continued.

This hall ended in a room as most halls do, but this was actually a small grouping of rooms whose configuration does not seem to fit with the original scope of the environment. Which I am to therefore conclude that they were built or remodeled after the original construction. But this is beside the point, the rooms held several thing of value to us. First in our way we found several new creatures; Firewing Drakes, and Junior Salamander Lancers.

After warning Faylinn that her fire magics would be less than useful to us in this situation Rathmine led the charge.  Using our terrain to our advantage we bottlenecked the creatures in the room and picked them of one by one. Rathmine cleaved through two of our foes. Flashy pants dazed and flourished his spikes. I fired a few shots that met their marks. And Faylinn?? Well she stood back and spent the time playing with her sputtering arcane projectile. After the battle we comforted her in the fact that everyone has a bad encounter or two once in a while when the just can't get thier arcane projectile off.

But back to the matter that was then at hand. These beings were but guards. And guards of what? Well of course from my introduction you know that they must be guarding the fire temple. So our unfalteringly brave crew stepped forth and into the adjacent camber. This room that we entered being by far the most opulent of the rooms so far. Chairs a table, chest, rick cloths, oh yeah and a lying weasel of a man named Lareth. A lengthly verbal banter ensued. During which I steadfastly held guard at the door in case we were to be ambushed. We had heard of this man and his alleged atrocities before. His sly tongue wound its way through the ears of non-fey companions and would have should we (Faylinn and I) not have been there would surely have led to his escape. Instead we had him cornered and with intent to bring him in to custody and return to town. But he underestimated us and the speed and fury of reactions. As he went for his sword I fired a swift arrow deep into his shoulder, Rathmine swooped in and swept his legs out from underneath. And Faylinn bless her heart gave up on he arcane projectile and burst forth with a forceful orb. Unfortunately we were unable to extract any more information. This being due to the fact of Larenth taking the full force of Faylinn's orb had left him limp and lifeless upon the floor.

We scoured the room for a clue, information, anything we could find. A nifty dagger for Flashypants, and a scroll were our rewards. The scroll made our situation ever more dire though. As it layed out plans to both amass a hundred troops, and to establish an informant in the town of homlett.

Collecting our poor and unfortunate companions from their hovel we raced to back to Homlett to warn Jaroo, and the town.
