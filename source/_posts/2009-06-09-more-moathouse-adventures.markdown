We certainly had a lot on our hands yesterday at the Moathouse! 

After the rest we took once the ogre was dead, we found that he had kept prisoners, and that three were still alive.  We found two humans (apparently merchants most recently in [Shadowdale](/places/shadowdale.html)) and a dwarf.  Though they were all in bad shape, the dwarf was worst off, and FP was good enough to give him his healing potion.  In thanks, the dwarf gave FP an iron ring.  We do not yet know if it has any value either monetarily or magially, but the gesture was lovely, as I'm sure FP would agree, and he now wears the ring on his finger.

For now, though, the group of three still waits for our return to lead them back to [Hommlet](/places/hommlet.html).  After all, we have yet to figure out the depths of villany at the moathouse, and we could neither abort our mission nor split up.  We did give them directions to the town, as well as instructions to see [Tifalius](/people/tifalius.html) when they arrived--just in case we were captured or killed before we could return to them.  But they apparently would rather wait for our escort than venture back alone, which I think a very wise decision (and one I did not hesitate to urge them toward!).   

The moathouse is far larger than it first seemed--mainly owing to the fact that it has level after level below ground.  After leaving the prisoners, we ventured down the secret ladder FP had discovered earlier, where we were rather quickly beset upon by four ghouls and a Banshee.  The four of us did not have too much trouble with them, and once finished with the battle, we continued our survey of the level.  

Through one passage, we found a curious and highly suspicious trail of gold coins, spaced evenly along a narrow corrider.  I removed the coins with my mage hand to check for traps.  The fact that there weren't any made us more rather than less wary--after all, someone put them there!--and we decided to try another direction for the time being.  After following long, winding tunnels and a shallow stairway down, we came across a pool... a pool that housed a Giant crawfish of all things!  Again, our group had little trouble killing the beast, but we did decide to avoid resting in the room, as we do not know what else the pool may hold.  Notably, we uncovered some very valuable treasure on the lip of the pool--two bejeweled rings and a half dozen or so spells!  Our party has yet to decide which, if any, I shall inscribe in my spellbook.
