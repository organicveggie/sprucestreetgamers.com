# That Which Lurks
## Chaotic Evil Greater God

{% img right /images/ghaunadaur_symbol.jpg %}

The God of Abominations was formerly a member of the drow pantheon but following the War of the Spider Queen in 1379 DR he left the Demonweb Pits and created a new realm in the Deep Caverns.

Ghaunadaur is an unpredictable deity. False worshipers may be rewarded by it, sometimes even with permanent magical boons, but they might just as well be devoured by _The Elder Eye_ without a second thought. Ghaunadaur enjoys watching large horrible monsters as they hunt and devour their prey, causing much suffering. When Ghaunadaur leaves the Inner Planes he is always silent, but some old records mention a gibbering and bestial language being spoken in the godâ€™s court. When communicating it uses telepathy and keeps its conversations blunt and simple.

### Dogma

_All creatures have their place, and all are fit to wield power. Those who hunt weed out the weak and strengthen the stock of all. Those who rebel or who walk apart find new ways and try new things and do most to advance their races. Creatures of power best house the energy of life, which Ghaunadaur reveres and represents. Make sacrifices to the Eye, persuade others to sacrifice themselves to Ghaunadaur or in service of the Eye, further knowledge and fear of Ghaunadaur, and in the end give yourself to Ghaunadaur in unresisting self-sacrifice. Convert all beings to the worship of Ghaunadaur. Slay all clergy of other faiths, plundering their temples and holdings for wealth to better your own lot and to further the worship of Ghaunadaur._
