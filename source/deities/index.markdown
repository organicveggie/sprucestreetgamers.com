Technically, we have two sets of deities: the deities outlined in the Player’s Handbook and the deities that correspond to the Forgotten Realms (Faerun). I have decided to combine both pantheons together in a two tiered fashion.

18 primary gods and goddesses control the primary dominions of the Astral Plane. Some of these 18 gods have lesser gods that share their principles and dwell in the same plane. Additionally, some of these greater and lesser gods have exarchs (divine servants) underneath them. And finally, 5 primordials rule over of the elemental planes.
