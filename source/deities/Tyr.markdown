# The Maimed God
## Lawful Good God

{% img right /images/tyr_symbol.jpg %}

Deity of law and justice and part of The Triad. His dogma is primarily concerned with the punishment of wrong-doers, and the general furthering of law and good in the world.

At some point between 1374 and 1479 DR, Tyr died fighting off a demonic invasion of Celestia; his portfolio of justice was subsequently absorbed by [Bahamut](/deities/Bahamut.html) and [Torm](/deities/Torm.html).
