# The Keeper of the Yellow Sun
## Lawful Good Greater God

{% img right /images/Amaunator.jpg %}

### Amaunator
Amaunator is the reincarnated deity of the sun, the timekeeper of the gods. Though some say he died, he actually transformed into Lathander, and was worshiped under that name for centuries before finally reclaiming both his name and his mission in 1479 DR. He causes the sun to burn and sets its course across the sky, giving rise to the celestial clock by which all time is measured.

### Lathander
Lathander, whose title is The Morninglord, was the neutral good aspect of Amaunator, worshiped in earlier days as a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring, self-perfection, vitality and youth. He favours those who dispel the undead and blesses those who plant new life. Lathander is also the god called upon to bless birth and fertility related ceremonies.
